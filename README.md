# LSTM Model for Smart Grids

## Overview
This repository implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model** to enhance the efficiency of smart grids by forecasting electricity demand, optimizing energy distribution, and detecting anomalies.

## Why LSTM for Smart Grids?
Smart grids generate vast amounts of time-series data, including power consumption, voltage levels, and renewable energy outputs. LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), excel at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for:

- **Load Forecasting**: Predicting future energy demand to optimize grid operations.
- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Enhancing the stability of solar/wind energy sources.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying faults or irregular consumption patterns.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Historical energy data is cleaned, normalized, and formatted into sequences.
2. **Model Training**: An LSTM network is trained to recognize consumption patterns.
3. **Prediction & Analysis**: The model forecasts future demand, helping grid operators make data-driven decisions.
